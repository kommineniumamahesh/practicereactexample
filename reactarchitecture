**Frontend Framework:** React.js  
**State Management:** Redux (or Context API)  
**Routing:** React Router  
**UI Library:** Material-UI (or any preferred UI library)  
**Form Handling:** React Hook Form  
**API Integration:** Axios for HTTP requests  
**Build Tool:** Vite  
**Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress  
**Prerequisite:** Node.js

### 3. Prerequisite: Node.js

**Description:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to run JavaScript on the server side and is used for the development and build processes of the React.js project.

**Role in the Project:**
- **Development Environment:** Node.js provides the runtime environment for tools like Vite, enabling the development server, hot module replacement (HMR), and other development features.
- **Package Management:** Node.js includes npm (Node Package Manager) or can be used with yarn, which manages the project's dependencies and scripts.
- **Build Process:** Node.js runs the build scripts that compile and bundle the React application for production.
